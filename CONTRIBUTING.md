# How to start contributing
Just drop a Pull Request :)

# Pull Request style
1. Use LF. Set up your Git settings with this: `git config --global core.autocrlf false` and check if it is OK by `git config --global core.autocrlf`. It need to return `false` or nothing.
2. Use spaces, size: `4`!

*When changing `.scss` files, be sure you save and compile file you changed and also compile `styles.scss`*
